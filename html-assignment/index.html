    <p>My name is Cole Zito. I was born on August 26<sup>th</sup> and raised here in Ottawa, with my mother immigrating from Portugal, and my father like me being born here.
     Some of my intrests include:
     <ul> 
         <li>>video games,</li>
        <li> watching, playing and <em>loving</em> soccer,</li>
        <li> spending time with the people I love.</li>
      My dream career path is working in sports media,
     hopefully getting the opportunity to create fantastic videos or design webpages for some of the biggest sports clbus in the world.

    <p>Throughout my highschool journey, I was never too sure on what I should pursue in post secondary.
    Luckily, I realized my favourite class, communications technology, was a greating starting place for pursuing courses such as this.
    I then applied to the course and I couldn't be happier. Designing is a true passion of mine and I believe this course will allow that to shine through clearly.
